# Image-manipulation-with-NumPy
This project demonstrates image processing techniques using NumPy in Python. The object-oriented design ensures clean modular transformations while preserving transparency.

__Key Features__:

Color inversion without affecting transparency

Grayscale conversion

90-degree rotation

Horizontal mirroring

Adjustable transparency

Brightness enhancement

Adding black borders

Changing transparent background to green

Swapping blue and yellow pixels

Applying a sepia effect

Each manipulation is visualized with before-and-after images, all integrated in a Jupyter notebook.
